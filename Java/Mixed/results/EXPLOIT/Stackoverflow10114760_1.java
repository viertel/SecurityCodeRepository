Lets say your HTML page does an ajax call to the backend and you return the result. I am just giving you a jquery example after the success

$.each(data, function(){
$('div.result').append(this);
});

you will notice that data was just appended without validation. What if data came from a script kiddie and entered
//this might not be the correct syntax

since you are not validating your input, the user can just enter anything and the above code will steal the cookie of who ever clicks the link.
