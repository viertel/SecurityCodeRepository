public Player(String name){
        this.name = name;
        this.attackStrength = Random.nextInt(10);
    }   

--> max attack: 10

If I serialised this class It would provide me with a byte array that represented the object instance and its internal values (name, attackStrength).
If I edited the byte array and read back in. I could modify the bytes that represent attackStrength to 50! and then DeSerialise the array and I now have a hacked character.
